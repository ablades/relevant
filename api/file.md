 Comment: [37m Absolute amateur noob question. From someone with many hours across D1 and D2.

The element on armour, is there a point to it? Is it worth having the same element on all armour pieces?
Does it work better in any way to have the same element subclass for matching armour element?

Or do you just use whatever has the best stats?

Thanks;) [0m

 Comment: [37m Just to preface, it&#39;s not lag or anything like that. 

I forget to record it, but I see it a lot with high skill players.(playing on console) 

They&#39;ll dodge, but it&#39;s like the animation is going in one direction, but the character model goes in a different direction, then they pair it with a jump and all this happens within a fraction of a second. It&#39;s almost impossible to track. 

I really don&#39;t get it, usually with regular hunters I can track through the dodges, got a ton of &#34;dodge this&#34; medals. But sometimes... It&#39;s like... Weird 

Like today, saw a guy dodge, and I swear he slowed down mid dodge.

Just at a loss

 Comment: [37m TLDR: As an admirer of the gambit prime system of prime armor sets, I wish that perhaps armor that is tied to endgame content that isn&#39;t raids have an extra layer of unique power to them, thus adept armor.

Adept Weapons are a great chase to have in the game, for pve and pvp players alike but they don&#39;t live up to the name in my opinion. 

Most people have already suggested this idea that adepts don&#39;t feel too special so rather than focus on that I want to focus on the concept of adept armor.

Raid Armor like GOS, LW, and DSC have their own set of raid mods, which is great and sets them apart from other armor in that raid setting. Armor from places like GMs and Trials only have a difference of a handful of stat points that may make your build 2% closer to perfection but it doesn&#39;t feel all that unique, its strong but its missing that unique flavor.

With sunsetting out of my picture, I masterworked the armor I have and have put together a stat distribution which I will be &#34;fine&#34; with using forever, never bothering to take it off for anything else that comes down the pipeline also due to the combat style mod slot for CwL and Warmind Cells (and I guess wells to some extent). Even my fashion game is set in stone when transmog comes around so what I&#39;m trying to say is every single piece of armor I see is instantly sharded now as there is literally no point in me trying to change up my armor for different activities other than raids.

**This isn&#39;t all bad, people tend to say that armor is a vehicle for the combat style mods, which is a sentiment I agree with but I felt that bungie was going somewhere with the introduction of Gambit Prime Armor sets**

I am a previous gambit prime addict and reckoner, so I&#39;ve gotten very familiar with how the system worked and thus I really enjoyed it, having to make the choice between a five set or an exotic would add a new level to the gear game**\***

**\*The hard choice could be bypassed by the use of the gambit synths soooo, it was kinda floundered upon but you see the idea.** 

Having class agnostic bonuses akin to exotics with an excellent example being the new rework of the aeon cult exotics is a great foundation for a concept of &#34;adept armor&#34;. 

Bonuses can range anywhere from 

* the increases of loot or materials/drop chances of said loot (i.e Ghost Mods)
* To game changing exotic perks (i.e Aeon Cult) [0m

Armor from places like GMs and Trials only have a difference of a handful of stat points that may make your build 2% closer to perfection but it doesn&#39;t feel all that unique, its strong but its missing that unique flavor.

With sunsetting out of my picture, I masterworked the armor I have and have put together a stat distribution which I will be &#34;fine&#34; with using forever, never bothering to take it off for anything else that comes down the pipeline also due to the combat style mod slot for CwL and Warmind Cells (and I guess wells to some extent). Even my fashion game is set in stone when transmog comes around so what I&#39;m trying to say is every single piece of armor I see is instantly sharded now as there is literally no point in me trying to change up my armor for different activities other than raids.

Having class agnostic bonuses akin to exotics with an excellent example being the new rework of the aeon cult exotics is a great foundation for a concept of &#34;adept armor&#34;.

 Comment: [37m Hello Guardians,

I’m in absolute love with Dead man’s Tales. Was a bit late on the season but couldn’t pass a Tex Machina gun. Managed to get a snapshot roll on my second week and now really want the masterwork.

The thing is... I play on Stadia. The problem is not how the game perform (it works perfectly if you have good internet, try it by yourself it’s 100% free) but the extremely small community makes hard content difficult if you are mostly a solo player like me without a clan who just matchmake into most activities.

Now I’m 1317 LL and pretty decent at the game so I was wondering if doing Presage solo was something possible or should I struggle to find 2 other people to do it.

Advices appreciated. [0m

I tried to do Solo Master Bunker E15 for and I firmly believe that it is almost impossible to kill an overload Captain currently (without overloading void grenades for Hunter; idk other classes). Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure more skilled players or different builds could beat it but I couldn’t pass the first room. Cleared out all the adds and with overload smg &#43; anarchy, I couldn’t beat him one on one. So I tried overload lament... I couldn’t even land a hit on him. He would teleport away even with invisibility. It was impossible to overload him. 

In conclusion, the teleporting capabilities &#43; constant healing of Overload Captains is intoxicating. Don’t get me wrong, I think master should be difficult but half the times I fought him it, his teleportation made him impossible to hit and overload smg is garbage (only working half way down the mag - p.s I’m already dead). 

Pls nerf overload Captains or improve the function of overload smg. Or in a perfect world, bring back overload grenades (Yes I’m aware that unreasonable) 

Thank you for listening to my rant - hopefully I’ll get Splintered another day. (And to think I spent hours getting brigs kills)

Edit: Ty to everyone telling me to use bows. I will definitely try

This piece of soundtrack also has the darkness theme in the background a little bit. And is also the best beyond light soundtrack out of all.

Bungie has the best game soundtrack ever in my opinion. Thank you bungie.

 Comment: [37m The recent rise of the Plague Gang on Twitter got me thinking about Siva again. I didn&#39;t realize how many people actually thought the Siva threat was over after we killed Aksis in the Perfection Complex. The final fallen WOTM Siva node, Dormant SIVA: Fallen 3.9, is from Aksis&#39;s point of view. He talks about making a decision. Only, he didn&#39;t feel like it was truly a decision. As though someone made it for him. Siva was supposed to free him from his body and make him ascend, and yet he doesn&#39;t even feel in control as something as simple as a decision. He felt as though there was another consciousness controlling him. There is a high chance that he is just referring to his old self which would thus disprove this theory, but what if it wasn&#39;t. Well, that begs the question, who? The most obvious answer to most is Rasputin. However, I find this unlikely for a multitude of reasons. I&#39;m not going to go into detail but if you know the recent lore behind Rasputin you&#39;ll see why I think this. Who else? This part is really wishful thinking and highly speculative, but what if the darkness was the one puppeteering Aksis and the splicers. The way the fallen describe both the ascension Siva provides as well as the salvation darkness provides is similar in nature. If the darkness is the true mind behind Siva, that would allow Siva to actually be a new darkness subclass thus fitting Bungie&#39;s plan. It would also mean the threat of Siva is still alive so it could be the focus of a season or expansion.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If you actually made it this far through my dumb theory, thank you. [0m

 Comment: [37m Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do enjoy this new team dynamic with all these previous people we barely had screen time with. I like the witty banter and passive aggressiveness. But the one thing I did love about the original 3 vanguard&#39;s, zavala, ikora, and cayde, was that cayde brought the comedic relief to the table. I&#39;m a sucker for comedy relief, it freshened up missions. Quirked up dialogue. Cayde was the inner child in us all when we played destiny. He backed us up when zavala or ikora would disagree on some tactics. He was the wild card we not only needed, but wanted. I know people will be like &#34;he&#39;s been dead forever, get over it&#34; but the character dynamic is just sassy and serious now and I don&#39;t like it lol [0m

 Comment: [37m Not sure how easy this would be but a filter feature where you could block posts based on content would be useful to kill common reposts. I&#39;m envisioning a multi pronged solution may be needed. Once the user selects filter   &amp;gt; this and future reposts; sync  
1) blocks post with exact match title.  
2) blocks posts with exact match URL.  
3) gets a hash of the content (IMG/vid) and blocks matching posts [0m

I don&#39;t have nsfw hidden in my filters settings, only nsfw previews are turned off.  Not sure what changed, I was getting them recently. [0m

 Comment: [37m So, my &#39;16 Q5 MMI screen and all related functionality went dark this weekend. I installed the RSNAV standalone unit just after the new year and it had been working without issue. I spent a couple of days troubleshooting, thinking it may be a failed amplifier, though I couldn&#39;t find any evidence to support that. I purchase a MOST loopback tester because I was getting an Optical bus error in Carista, however, when I pulled out the amplifier the second time there was no optical signal at all for any device in the trunk. During these few days, the RSNAV was connecting to my phone whenever I turned on the car, so assumed it was not the problem. Finally, I decided to disconnect the RSNAV as a last resort. When I removed the RSNAV main connection and returned to the direct stock connection, everything began to work again. Fortunately, when I reconnected the RSNAV, everything still worked; there must have been a problem with the main harness connection, but everything seemed tight and locked. It is all working again now, but I wanted to post this as a reference for others in the future. [0m

 Comment: [37m I have a 2013 audi A1 and I need to get the radio de-coded. I replaced the radio recently and this is the message that comes up 

https://preview.redd.it/0s1bh5ahcln61.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c8696053659c034d8226f1d325e3b4e2ba659ae8

I&#39;m assuming I need to decode the new radio but does anyone know how? I can&#39;t find the radios serial code either, its meant to start with AU but I can&#39;t see a number on the radio with that on it :(

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Any help would be super appreciated, thank you! [0m
